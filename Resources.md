# Resources  
  
### Newsletters  
Newsletters are a very important source of receiving domain specific information about events, research and people relevant to one's industry of work. Here is a list of few newsletters which I think are very good to subscribe to:  
  1. **NYU Data Science Newsletter** - I am a personal fan of this newsletter. The layout is simple and the content is rich with information and some light humour. It is a bi-weekly newsletter and you can check it out [here](http://cds.nyu.edu/newsletter/).  
  2. **Data Elixir** - You can check it out [here](https://dataelixir.com/)
  3. **Data is Plural** - A fantastic resource to know about new and interesting datasets. Compiled regularly by Jeremy Singer Vine, this is a one-stop-shop for interesting datasets - data + metadata + links. There is also link to a spreadhsheet that contains details about the recently added datasets along with their summary and links. I would highly recommend you to check this out [here](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural).

### Books  
There are a lot of books out there about data science topics. And you will find many of them for each topic. However, there are a few books which introduce you (and do that well) to data science. One of them is  
1. **Doing Data Science** by **_Rachel Schutz and Cathy O'Neill_**: This book is admittedly low on details of underlying concepts, and this is very useful for novice readers who don't want (or even need to) read the details right away.
2. **Machine Learning** by **_Tom Mitchell_**: Don't go by the size of this book. Although it was written long back, this book is gold - it will not talk about the latest techniques but instead, provide you a patient yet concise (great combination, eh?) explanation of different machine learning approaches and topics. It covers a lot of breadth - which is why it makes for a very good read for a sound introduction to machine learning.  
3. **Weapons of Math Destruction** by **_Cathy O'Neil_**

### Online courses  
Thanks to the efforts of the open-source community, most of the information about technology and machine learning is free for use - which makes on-the-job learning easier providing a really good way for skills development throughout one's career trajectory. While there are many resources available, some need a special mention:  
1. **Coursera**: [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) is a website offering video lectures from prestigious institutes and universities across the world on an array of topics - not just technology. There are courses on humanities, biology, music and so on. Best of all, you can view these videos and complete your coursework at your own pace.  
2. **Udemy**: [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) is similar to Coursera - although most of the courses are not free. I haven't tried the product, so I would not be the right person to give any advice on this.

### Software   
It is very important to have the right software that works not just for the problem you are trying to solve but also you - the coder. Coding gives you the power to convert your thoughts and animated ideas from the whiteboards in maeeting rooms to actual output - a chart, a presentation, a machine learning model and so on. Coding is not difficult. Also, remember, it does not need a lot of time but a lot of patience.
1. **Jupyter**: One of my favourite tools for coding - I am in love with this software. This software takes you away from the seemingly scary world of black screens and terminals to the beautiful world of notebooks where you can interactively code in your language of choice on a screen with cells which can be executed independently making prototyping really easy. And what's more - you can write text alongside our code seamlessly to create something called as 'notebook' - which is a really cool and easy way to share information with non-users.  
Jupyter can be used to code in **_Ju_**lia, **_Pyt_**hon and **_R_**uby (hence then name Jupyter).
You can download Jupyter [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

### Websites  
1. **Data.world**: This is a cool website to find some interesting datasets. Check it out [here](https://data.world/).  
2. **Kaggle**: A website for online machine learning competitions - contains some great datasets, knowledge and resources. Check it out [here](https://www.kaggle.com).
