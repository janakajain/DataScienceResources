### Newsletters  
Newsletters are a very important source of receiving domain specific information about events, research and people relevant to one's industry of work. Here is a list of few newsletters which I think are very good to subscribe to:  
  1. **NYU Data Science Newsletter** - I am a personal fan of this newsletter. The layout is simple and the content is rich with information and some light humour. It is a bi-weekly newsletter and you can check it out [here](http://cds.nyu.edu/newsletter/).  
  2. **Data Elixir** - You can check it out [here](https://dataelixir.com/)
  3. **Data is Plural** - A fantastic to know about the new and interesting datasets. There is also link to a spreadhsheet that contains details about the recently added datasets along with their summary and links. I would highly recommend you to check this out [here](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural).

### Books  
There are a lot of books out there about data science topics. And you will find many of them for each topic. However, there are a few books which introduce you (and do that well) to data science. One of them is  
1. **Doing Data Science** by **_Rachel Schutz and Cathy O'Neill_**: This book is admittedly low on details of underlying concepts, and this is very useful for novice readers who don't want (or even need to) read the details right away.
